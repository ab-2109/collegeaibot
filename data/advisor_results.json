    "summary": "You\u2019re a very strong applicant academically (4.0 UW/4.35 W, class rank #2, SAT 1570 with 800 Math, rigorous AP STEM). For Engineering, the most selective programs are still reaches for everyone, so I\u2019m balancing top-tier \u201cExtreme Reaches\u201d with realistic \u201cTarget Match\u201d options and a couple of high-likelihood \u201cSafety\u201d schools that still have solid engineering outcomes. Note: many universities do not offer Spring entry for first-year applicants in Engineering, so you should verify Spring 2027 availability for each school (or plan for Fall 2027 if needed).",
