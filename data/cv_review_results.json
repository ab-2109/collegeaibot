Your application should read as: 'I build engineering solutions that measurably improve X,' supported by numbers, artifacts (GitHub, CAD, demos), and external validation.",

Example options (pick ONE and go deep): (A) Hardware/robotics: design a low-cost sensor system (air quality/water leakage/energy monitoring) deployed in your community; target 25\u2013100 installations or 3\u20135 institutional partners. (B) Software/ML: build an engineering tool (e.g., predictive maintenance, scheduling optimization, CAD-to-BOM automation) with 500\u20132,000 users or adoption by 2\u201310 organizations. (C) Climate/energy: build an energy audit + retrofit recommendation pipeline for small businesses; aim to audit 30\u201360 sites and document estimated kWh/$ saved. Publish a website, GitHub repo, and a 2-minute demo video; track monthly active users, deployments, accuracy, savings, or time reduced.",

(2) Research competitions: Regeneron ISEF-affiliated fairs (aim: regional win/ISEF qualification). (3) Olympiad/academic comps: USACO (Silver/Gold), AMC/AIME, F=ma, Science Olympiad medals.

Then build 3 proof points: (1) origin story (why you care), (2) technical arc (how your skills grew\u2014AP Physics/Calc + projects), (3) impact arc (who benefited, quantified).
